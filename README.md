![Node: Authentication][lil-thumbnail-url] 

If you have a website, you want visitors. And if you run a business through a website, you want those visitors to be customers. To do that, you need user registration and authentication. Authentication is the foundation of most web applications, letting you determine who is visiting your site and helping you connect them with privileges they should or should not have. This project shows how to add user registration and authentication to an app built with Node.js and Express.js.
